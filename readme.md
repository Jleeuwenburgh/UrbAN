# UrBAN

This is the repository for the thesis project Urban Amenities Navigator (UrbAN).
This repository contains the files needed to run the dashboard.

## Installation
Before running the dashboard, make sure you have the right python environment set up.
All the dependencies are listed in the `req.txt` file.
The python version used is 3.8
Suggested is to use conda to create a new environment with the following command:
```bash 
conda create --name myenv --file req.txt
``` 
where `myenv` is the name of the environment you want to create.


## Running the dashboard
To run the dashboard, you need to run the `app.py` file.
This will run the dashboard on a local server.
